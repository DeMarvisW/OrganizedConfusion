# Function =  a block of reusable code
#             place () after the function's name to invoke it.

# Define a function = "def" + "Create a Name" + parenthesis followed by : 
# Any code that belongs to function you'll be required to indent underneath.

# def Happy_Birthday(name, age):
#    print(f"Happy birthday to {name}!")
#    print(f"You are {age}")
#    print(f"Happy birthday to {name}!")
#    print()

# To invoke the function you type the name of the function with parenthesis i.e: Happy_Birthday()
# Using whats called an argument you can send data directly to a function.
# via placing a parameter within the function (a temp variable):
# In order to invoke you need a matching number of arguments. Can't have only one but attempt to invoke two.

# def Happy_Birthday("One", 2):
#    print("Happy birthday to {name}!")
#    print("how old are you?")
#    print("Happy birthday to you!")
#    print()
# happy_Birthday("Martian", 35)

# Happy_Birthday("Martian", 35)
