i = 0
while i < 3:
    print("Meow")
    i += 1

#in C wewould also do this:

for (int i = 0: i <3; i++)
{
    printf("Meow"\n");
    }

    #python this code would be annoying / wrap on itself / you have to write out ",1" ",2"

    for i in [0, 1, 2]:
      print("hello, world")

    #Alternative

    for i in range(3):
        Print("hello, world")
